# Java Practice Repository

This repository contains my Java practice work, including **algorithm exercises** and **mini console projects**.

## Contents
- **Algorithms (A01–A30)**: Fundamental algorithm implementations (loops, arrays, search, sort, recursion, HashMap, Stack, BST, etc.)

- **Mini Projects (P01–P13)**: Small console-based projects to improve problem-solving and Java programming skills
